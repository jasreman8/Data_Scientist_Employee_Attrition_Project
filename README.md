# Data_Scientist_Employee_Attrition_Project

## Context:
This analysis investigates employee attrition within a company, using HR data to identify patterns and factors contributing to employees leaving.

## Objective:
The main goal is to understand the drivers of employee attrition and provide actionable insights to reduce turnover and improve retention.

## Key Questions:

What are the main factors influencing employee attrition?
Are there specific departments or roles with higher attrition rates?
How do demographic and job-related variables affect attrition?
Can we predict which employees are at risk of leaving?

## Problem Foundation:
Employee attrition leads to increased costs, loss of knowledge, and disruption in operations. By analyzing historical HR data, we can uncover trends and build predictive models to identify at-risk employees.

## Recommendations for Implementation:

Focus retention efforts on high-risk groups identified in the analysis.
Address key factors such as job satisfaction, compensation, and work-life balance.
Implement regular employee feedback mechanisms.
Use predictive analytics to proactively engage employees likely to leave.
Monitor and review attrition metrics periodically to assess the impact of interventions.
